## 10/29/2025 - Set up KiCad & Sheets w/ project libraries  

Added necessarily libraries to KiCad and followed the Split Keyboard tutorial to add OPL, modified OPL kicad utilities, marabastlib, and panelization.pretty.

Added Schematic Sheets to the schematic.

## 10/30/2025 - Designed Circuitry  

Made all the circuitry for the keyboard, including mount points. I also organized the entire project, as I just discovered how to use the box & text features in KiCad.

Ran into some issues with labelling before I realized that if you place the label right on a connection point, there's not really a visual connector.

The left circuitry:

The Main Board circuitry:

(not sure if that one is right, but I guess I'll find out once I get to the actual PCB)

Now I'm just waiting on a reply from a help thread I asked in Slack about Footprint libraries, couldn't find marbastlib footprints.

Ultimately, this section of the project ended up taking a LOT longer than I originally anticipated, 2 hours and 15m for circuitry, but things should speed up when it gets to 3D model design because I have experience with that.
